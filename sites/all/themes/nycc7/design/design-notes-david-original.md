Free of specific constraints, I put together a content and design that fits my assessment of the club as the #1 organization for recreational rides in the NYC area. It targets local cyclists of all levels, both members and potential members, with an interest in recreational riding, group and solo.


### Put forward the people and activities of the club.

This is a dynamic club with a lot to offer (rides, events, information, gear) to new-yorkers who enjoy riding their bikes for fun and fitness. Joining any club came be intimidating. Joining a group ride even more so. The focus on the people of the club underlines how inclusive of all levels and styles it is and therefore nothing to be scared about. The opening hero image bloc would rotate images of different types of rides (CP loops, Bear Mountain, RR, etc.) and riders with different overlaid text pointing out interesting information: number of members, date of creation, etc.

Logged in members would not see the big introductory hero image. Instead they would first see the club news section.


### Rides are the heart of the club.

Therefore current ride information is immediately visible (non-members don't see some ride details) to all visitors right up top. This is a practical location (I bet 95% of member visits to the site are ride lookups) but it is also a way of underlining that rides are the focus of this club.

A calendar-type events bloc might be necessary as reference information to complement the Club News bloc which will include more than just events.

ENY get a year-round countdown that underlines the event's importance and serves as a catchy draw in to find out more.


### This is New York City's cycling club.

With a revamped style and more relevant content it could become a central connection for all cyclists in NYC, members or not. It is also a weekly presentation of the club's activities and capabilities. Therefore the newsletter sign up form is given prominence.

The NYCC should own the New York City-marked cycling apparel market. Anyone from out of town or leaving town wants a NYC-marked jersey/jacket/cap/bottle/etc. The NYCC is the best place to get them: easy, stylish and legitimate (from an actual cycling club unlike NYC jerseys sold at REI). Of course marked apparel is also a terrific way to display club membership. Are the members proud of the club? Team kits rule the road it seems (Foundation, Luca & Castaldi, Jordan, etc.). Why isn't the NYCC jersey the most commonly seen jersey?

Pro tip: use Square's Marketplace as a fully fledged online store. It's free, reliable and very well designed.

Your can't be a New York recreational cyclist and be indifferent to local riding conditions which are often a matter of life and death. The NYC cycling scene is very active and dynamic therefore local news has it's own bloc with a space to highlight an important advocacy issue.


### Finally, *we are cyclists*.

Hence the technical tips section. Something educational, probably aimed at the beginner rider. Outsourcing it to Damon (Nomad) is a way to thank him for all he has done for the club and, maybe more importantly, not have to worry about coming up with copy every week.

As an information service to visitors and a way of connecting with local stores, a deal of the week or month section might complement it.

As I mentioned in an earlier email some smart NYCC-unrelated content on riding in the NYC region would make for fascinating secondary websites: Riding safely in NYC, the History of cycling in NYC, etc. They would help extend the NYCC brand and bring in more members. If that is too ambitious, shorter content on these topics can be added to the NYCC site.


A simpler Menu and a simpler website.

This menu makes sense to the visitor. All the key elements are present as top menu items in 2 small menus that easily scanned at a glance. All the site's content (except maybe ENY which may warrant its own menu item when the time comes) fits logically under these headings.

JOIN becomes a top menu-item. Why and How to join is crucial information for any club.

No drop-down menus: each menu item leads to a single page. Nowadays scrolling is a more natural form of navigation than clicking. Faster connections mean properly-built longer pages don't have to be slow any more. Example: there is no reason why the About information should be broken up into several pages. Club mission and profile / Club history / Staff profiles / Lifetime members / Club Admin Archives / Jersey Archives can all fit on a single page.


### Design & Layout.

(NB: the attached screen grab shows the site viewed on a large 24in. screen).

I am not much of a designer, which slowed me down a lot, but I gave it a try. The flat blocky design is current (gradients and 3d buttons are not).

Colors. A real designer would do a much better job and in as much as the new site will set a visual identity it may be worth getting proper help. The club needs to develop a real brand and that mean sticking with a design for a few years at least. At least these subdued-but-not-dull colors are not 1990s electric. A more modern and edgy palette might be true fluorescent which is now all rage for running and cycling. I don't have the skills to get that right.

The bloc layout adjusts well to different screen sizes.

### Content.

This website requires initial work: good opening images, clean images of the club apparel, at least one member portrait and text for the first profile, some local cycling news items, a first Mechanic's tip, partners' logos.

It also requires more on-going work from the content manager: News posts, Member profiles, NYC cycling news and the Mechanic's tip (provided by Damon)

An Instagram feed needs curating.

Advertising isn't allowed on the site but presumably partners can be listed. The club needs to be able to offer something in exchange for support from commercial entities, who BTW should be falling over themselves to reach the members of the #1 club in the country.
